## 1) 1.0.4.5

**Validity:** Valid

**Reason:** All octets are within the valid range (0-255) and there are exactly four octets.

**Class:** Class A

**Explanation:** The first octet (1) is between 1 and 126, which falls into Class A.

**Network ID:** 1.0.0.0

**Explanation:** For Class A, the first octet represents the Network ID, and the remaining three octets are for the Host ID. So, the network portion is 1, and the host portion is 0.0.0.

**Host ID:** 0.4.5

**Explanation:** The last three octets represent the Host ID.




## 2) 80.54.256.14

**Validity:** Invalid

**Reason:** The third octet (256) is greater than 255. Each octet in an IPv4 address must be between 0 and 255, inclusive.




## 3) 11.025.56.8

**Validity:** Invalid

**Reason:** The second octet (025) has a leading zero. While numerically equivalent to 25, leading zeros are generally not allowed in standard dotted-decimal notation for IPv4 addresses as they can be interpreted as octal numbers in some contexts, leading to ambiguity or errors.




## 4) 192.108.102.101

**Validity:** Valid

**Reason:** All octets are within the valid range (0-255) and there are exactly four octets.

**Class:** Class C

**Explanation:** The first octet (192) is between 192 and 223, which falls into Class C.

**Network ID:** 192.108.102.0

**Explanation:** For Class C, the first three octets represent the Network ID, and the last octet is for the Host ID. So, the network portion is 192.108.102, and the host portion is 0.

**Host ID:** 101

**Explanation:** The last octet represents the Host ID.




## 5) 1.100.11100010.10

**Validity:** Invalid

**Reason:** The third octet (11100010) is not a valid decimal number. Each octet in an IPv4 address must be a decimal number between 0 and 255, inclusive, and typically does not contain leading zeros (unless the number itself is 0) or more than three digits.




## 6) 228.4.10.25.208

**Validity:** Invalid

**Reason:** An IPv4 address must consist of exactly four octets (numbers separated by dots). This address has five octets.
